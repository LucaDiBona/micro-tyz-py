=== Builtin Functions

The following functions are all builtin and interpreted or compiled directly.
In the explanations below, `<?>` refers to an optional value that may or may not be provided.
`<&>` refers to an input that is passed by reference as opposed to value - if a block this is not processed but rather passed as data.
