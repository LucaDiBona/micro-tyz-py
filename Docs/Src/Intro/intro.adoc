These are the full docs of MicroTyz, the bedrock of the Tyz programming language. Whilst MicroTyz, also styled ŒºêçÑ, can be used on its own, it is better used as a foundation upon which to build another project. The key such project, and the one for which MicroTyz was developed, is the Tyz programming language, which is makes use of MicroTyz's advanced metaprogramming features to produce a fully fledged general purpose programming language.
